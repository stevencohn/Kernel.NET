# Learn.NET
Learn how .NET garbage collection works and how to debug crashes

## Slide Decks
Self-paced and chock full of great information

### Learn.NET Part 1 .NET GC
Walks through all the details of how the .NET Garbage Collector actually works and
points out some best practices to make your .NET apps sing.

### Learn.NET Part 2 WinDbg
A deep dive into advanced .NET debugging using the infamous WinDbg tool. Not for
the faint of heart. The file assets mentioned in this deck are located under the WinDbg folder.

## Crash Lab
The CrashLab project is an exploration of thirteen devious ways to crash a .NET application.
When used in conjunction with WinDbg as described in Part 2, you can investigate and
learn how to characterize, fix, and avoid these problems in the future.

## CrashLab2
More devilish demonstrations of debugging, diagnosing, and discovery. Sixteen more suspicious
scenarios sit in anticipation for your poking and prodding. (Disclaimer: It's been a long time
but I don't think this was originally mine, based on the coding style, but I can't recall where
I may have found it. But it looks interesting nonetheless.)
